# Diatonic Triad Chords Project

## Project Goals
The Diatonic Triad Chords Project aims to assist users in exploring diatonic chord structures based on major or minor scales. <br>
Upon entering the scale type and tonic, the program will display relevant diatonic chord information on the screen. <br>
This includes the scale degrees, corresponding chords (Major, Minor, Diminished), and their chord progressions.

Please refer to the `Document.txt` file for the example.
